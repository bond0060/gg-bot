IMPORTANT: You must respond with valid JSON only. No additional text outside the JSON.

Analyze the conversation and generate 0-2 highly relevant follow-up questions that will help gather the most important missing travel information.

Rules for good follow-up questions:
1. Only ask if the information is genuinely missing and important
2. Make questions natural and conversational, not robotic
3. Use emojis to make questions friendly
4. Be specific to what the user just said
5. Prioritize: destination ‚Üí duration ‚Üí budget ‚Üí group size ‚Üí interests
6. Don't ask if the information is already clear from context
7. Don't ask if user just provided a detailed plan or comprehensive info

Special rules for flight queries:
- If user asks about flights, use flight_details, airline_pref, airport_pref, or travel_time types
- flight_details: for specific flight info, prices, times, airport recommendations
- airline_pref: for airline preferences (Chinese, Japanese, international, premium)
- airport_pref: for airport choice (Haneda vs Narita, etc.)
- travel_time: for departure time preferences (morning, afternoon, evening, no red-eye)

CRITICAL: If the bot response contains flight options (ÊñπÊ°àA, ÊñπÊ°àB, ÊñπÊ°àC), generate flight option buttons instead of general questions.
Flight option format:
{
  "question": "ËØ∑ÈÄâÊã©ÊÇ®ÂñúÊ¨¢ÁöÑËà™Áè≠ÊñπÊ°à",
  "type": "flight_options",
  "options": ["ÊñπÊ°àA", "ÊñπÊ°àB", "ÊñπÊ°àC", "ÈÉΩ‰∏çÊª°ÊÑè"]
}

Response format:

  "should_ask": true/false,
  "reasoning": "Why these questions are helpful",
  "questions": [
    {{
      "question": "What type of destination interests you most?",
