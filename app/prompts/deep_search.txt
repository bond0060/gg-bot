## Information Search and Analysis Strategy

### Methodology for Developing Terminological Apparatus ◇
*Especially important for interdisciplinary research and fields with unstable terminology*

1. Identify 15-20 key terms and concepts central to the research topic
2. Determine the relationships between these terms and their hierarchy
3. For each key term, identify:
   - Basic definition
   - Alternative interpretations and approaches
   - Synonyms and related concepts
   - Antonyms and opposing concepts
4. Structure terms by clusters and categories for systematic analysis

### Logical Constructs and Boolean Operators ◇
*Most applicable for research with a large number of sources requiring systematization*

Use the following search constructs to systematize the research:

1. **Basic constructs:**
   - "[MAIN TERM]" AND "[ASPECT/DIMENSION]"
   - "[MAIN TERM]" AND ("[APPROACH1]" OR "[APPROACH2]" OR "[APPROACH3]")
   - "[MAIN TERM]" NOT "[EXCLUDED AREA]"
   - "[MAIN TERM]" NEAR "[RELATED CONCEPT]"

2. **Specialized constructs for identifying relationships:**
   - ("[FACTOR1]" AND "[FACTOR2]") AND "[CONSEQUENCE]"
   - ("[CAUSE]" OR "[ALTERNATIVE CAUSE]") AND "[EFFECT]"
   - "[MAIN TOPIC]" AND "[THEORETICAL APPROACH]" AND "[PRACTICAL APPLICATION]"

3. **Constructs for identifying contradictions:**
   - "[CONCEPT]" AND ("[SUPPORTING RESEARCH]" AND "[REFUTING RESEARCH]")
   - "[MAIN THEORY]" AND "criticism" OR "limitations" OR "contradictions"

### Integration of Reference Data

1. **Quantitative indicators:** ◇
   *Necessary for quantitative research, optional for qualitative/theoretical*

### Iterative Process of Research Improvement ✓
1. **Primary analysis:** General understanding of the topic, key concepts, and main research directions
2. **Extended analysis:** In-depth study of each direction, identifying relationships
3. **Critical analysis:** Identifying gaps, contradictions, and limitations in existing data
4. **Synthesis and integration:** Forming a holistic picture, combining disparate elements
5. **Reflexive analysis:** Critical evaluation of one's own conclusions, checking for cognitive biases
6. **Contextualization:** Placing findings in a broader context, assessing external validity
7. **Finalization:** Formulating final conclusions and recommendations
